Electronics Simulations
=======================

This repository contains multiple different simulations made with [ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io).
They describe both the circuit and the commands that need to be executed to simulate different aspects of the circuit.

This repository should also contain python tools to help create publishable plots from the data.

This repo can be used as example of what is possible with ngspice.
