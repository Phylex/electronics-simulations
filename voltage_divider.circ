Voltage divider 
* the above line is the title line
V1 in 0 1 
* define a voltage source connecting node 0 with node in with a voltage of 1 volt 
R1 in out 1k
* define a resistor of 1k between the nodes input and output 
R2 out 0 2k
* define a second resistor between node out and 0. Resistors must begin with the letter R
.end

* the next section is the control section it defines what ngspice actually does
